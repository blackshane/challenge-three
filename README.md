# Password Generator


## Prerequisites
    This program does not require prerequisites. It is a webpage available for all to view. 

## Description
    This application is used to generate a random password using user inputs for desired password criteria.
    The user selects the password length ranging from 8 characters to 128 characters. 
    The user must select the password length PLUS one character option for password to be generated.
    If the password criteria is not met, the user is prompted to provide additional information. 

  ## Deployment
    Open "Index.html" in a browser window.

## Challenges faced
    Challenges faced include creating a pop-up to prompt the user to enter password criteria and creating an alert for when criteria is not met. Another challenge faced was to create a function to allow the program to assign selected characters to create a randomly generated password.
